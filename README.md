Battle Boats - Enhanced Edition
This project is an enhanced and modernized version of the classic Battle Boats tutorial by Kurt Kaiser.

About The Project
The primary goal of this project was to practice analyzing and refactoring legacy Unity code. It takes the original codebase from an older version of Unity and adapts it to run optimally on a modern engine, while also introducing new features to improve the gameplay experience.

Key Features & Enhancements
Code Modernization: Adapted the legacy codebase for full compatibility with modern Unity versions.

Progressive Level System: Introduced a level-based system to add variety and new challenges.

Time-Based Challenge: Level 2 now features a timer to increase the game's intensity.

Strategic AI Advantage: In Level 3, the enemy AI can shoot twice per turn, allowing it to cover the playing board more quickly and effectively than the player.

Gameplay Pace Improvement: The overall speed of the game has been increased to create more dynamic and entertaining sessions.
